SETUP FOR MINECRAFT OVERVIEWER (Courtesy of FlukiestEmperor)
	0. Perform installation (see above)
	1. Edit MapMarkers.yml so that markers.json is placed in the same folder as your Minecraft Overviewer output
		Alternatively don't edit MapMarkers.yml, make a symlink (Linux):
			ln -s path/to/minecraft/server/bin/world/markers.json path/to/minecraft/map/markers.json
	2. Put player.png, player.php, and player_markers.js where the overviewer index.html is. (Optionally web_assets in your overviewer source directory)
		If you don't want to use player skins as the markers (requires PHP, allow_url_fopen, and ideally write permissions by your PHP user), copy player_markers_noskin.js and rename it to player_markers.js
	3. Add a line to your source overviewer index.html that reads:
		<script type="text/javascript" src="player_markers.js"></script>
	4. Run overviewer and everything should work
